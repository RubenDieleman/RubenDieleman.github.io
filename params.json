Previously, I held positions as [COFAS Marie Curie Fellow] (http://forte.se/om-forte/internationella-samarbeten/europa/cofas/) at the [University of Gothenburg] (http://pol.gu.se/english/?languageId=100001&disableRedirect=true&returnUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fpol.gu.se%2F) and as Junior Researcher at the [University of Twente] (https://www.utwente.nl/bms/pa/), where I also obtained by Ph.D. in 2014. \r\n\r\nMy teaching and research interest include European political parties, public opinion of political processes, and theories of representative democracy.\r\n\r\nAt the University of Twente I was part of the Dutch [European Social Survey] (http://www.europeansocialsurvey.org) and involved in the design and analyses of several population-based survey experiments that answer methodological and substantive research questions. I am also the co-principal investigator of the [2015 Swedish Party Membership survey] (http://partiforskning.gu.se/Forskning+om+partier/partimedlemsundersokning/party-membership-survey-2015). It contains information on political attitudes and behaviour of more than 10,000 members of seven political parties.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n###Publications  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Peer-reviewed journal articles**\r\n\r\n“[Emancipated Party Members: Examining Ideological Incongruence within Political Parties](http://ppq.sagepub.com/content/early/2016/06/22/1354068816655566.full.pdf+html)” *Party Politics*, forthcoming.
